# segconstants
getconsts.sh: Generates the list of system constants and values. Can be run alone, but is not of much use that way.
consttest.sh: Sanity check on getconsts.sh output: checks for possible duplicate values (that will result in ambiguous reverse mappings from literal values to names), and also checks for any variables that might be present in gosecco but that are not generated by getconsts.sh
gogen.sh: Generates compilable golang code containing the AllConstants[] table and associated lookup functions.
